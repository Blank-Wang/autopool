# autopool
Adaptive pooling operators for Multiple Instance Learning.

AutoPool is an adaptive (trainable) pooling operator which smoothly interpolates between common pooling operators, such
as min-, max-, or average-pooling, automatically adapting to the characteristics of the data.

AutoPool can be readily applied to any differentiable model for time-series label prediction. AutoPool is presented in the following paper, where it is evaluated in conjunction with convolutional neural networks for Sound Event Detection:
